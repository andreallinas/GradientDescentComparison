# Gradient Descent Methods Comparison 

I compared the effectiveness of 3 different Gradient Descent variants in predicting crime rates across multiple Florida counties. The objective was to model the relationship between crime rates (the dependent variable) and two independent variables: income and high school graduation rate (HS). The three algorithms under investigation are: Gradient Descent with Fixed Step Size, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and Gradient Descent with Momentum.
